  <h1>Hello World</h1>
  <h2>Cities I've lived in</h2>
    <p>I was born in Boulder and grew up there. I got a job in downtown Denver so moved to Denver to be close to the job.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Boulder<span>&#33;</span></li>
      <li>Denver<span>&#33;</span></li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Cities I want to visit</h2>
    <p>I have always wanted to visit Copenhagen! I almost studied abroad there. It looks like a beautiful city and I would love to go to Denmark. I have heard really good things about Berlin, and have never been to Germany. Finally, Amsterdam is another city I've been wanting to go to for a really long time - it looks like a beautiful city and I've also heard reallly good things about it.</p>
